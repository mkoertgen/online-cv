experiences:
  - role: Agile Project Lead & Analyst, DevOps Evangelist
    time: 2015 - Present
    company: Schönhofer Sales and Engineering (SSE), Germany
    details: |
      About 2015 i started **wearing many hats**, helping teams wherever i can,
      filling different roles and doing whatever needs to be done in order
      to **reduce waste & friction** and at the same time, **increase value & purpose**. 
      
      I advise in **architectural decisions**, help formulating **long-term company goals**, 
      **recommend & promote technology stacks**, contribute to **release & roadmap planning**
      and **assist in personal growth & development through coaching & mentoring**.
      
      Still, i do **lots of coding** - from **prototyping**, over **carving out MVPs for 
      marketing & production**, to helping to **maintain legacy codebases** (50k up to about 1M LOCs).
      
      This stems from the idea of the [Three Horizons of Innovation](https://steveblank.com/2015/06/26/lean-innovation-management-making-corporate-innovation-work/).

      Main contributions since 2015

        - **Recruiting, on-boarding & coaching new talent**
        - Shaping a **Meetup Culture** by organizing **weekly Talks**, facilitating **hands-on workshops**, ...
        - Introduced an internal **Technology Advisory Board**, i.e. a group of 
          senior technical scientists advising in _process, architectural_ and _technology aspects_
        - Established a **Technology Radar** (inspired by [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar)), mapping technology vs. project domains visualizingInspired by the [ThoughWorks Technology Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar)
        - Pushed **DevOps culture** (CI/CD, Docker, Ansible, ...)

  - role: Change Agent, Agile Coach
    time: 2014 - 2015
    company: Schönhofer Sales and Engineering (SSE), Germany
    details: |
      In 2012, the **Agile community** made a big impact on my personal development.
      As an engineer endorsed by the tenet that _"Anything can be solved by technology"_,
      it was ground-shaking to realize how **many problems were rooted in inter-personal
      issues** and thus needed to be adressed at this very level.

      It was in 2014-2015 were i helped **laying the groundworks of sustainable
      product development** and changing the company culture from 
      hierarchically-driven **towards self-empowered teams**.

      Main contributions during 2014-2015

        - Introduce **Dependency Management** (NuGet, Maven, Artifactory/Nexus, ...)
        - Supersede legacy SCMs (ClearCase, CVS) with **Git workflows** (e.g. GitFlow)
        - Promote **Agile Principles** (Scrum Ceremonies) & **XP Practices** (e.g. SOLID, TDD, Pair-Programming)
        - Introduce **Continuous Integration/Delivery/Deployment** (Jenkins & GitLab), powered by git workflows (Infrastructure as Code)
        - Shaping **Technical Debt Awareness** (SonarQube)

      Today, this would be called an instance of the [Inverse Conway Maneuver](http://jonnyleroy.com/2011/02/03/dealing-with-creaky-legacy-platforms/),
      i.e. evolving teams and organizational structure to promote the desired architecture.

  - role: Product Owner, Change Agent
    time: 2011 - 2013
    company: Schönhofer Sales and Engineering (SSE), Germany
    details: |
      After successfully launching the geo-solution in about a dozen projects, 
      i was offered the opportunity to help relaunching Schönhofers own 
      **Multimedia-Content Analysis and Reporting/Alerting solution**.
      
      This involved a great deal of **refactoring, re-organizing and integrating 
      a number of legacy codebases & services** into a new whole and **well-organized
      product**, with a **clearly structured, easy-to-grasp** and **intuitive UI**.

      During this time, i learned a lot about **balancing refactoring & technical debth** as well as
      the **tension between legacy architecture decisions and the urge for innovation**.

      Main technological areas involved

        - Text Mining, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Entity Extraction
        - Multimedia-Content Analysis, i.e.
          - Image & Video Feature Extraction
          - Voice, Speaker & Speech Recognition
        - Classical Business Intelligence (BI)
        - Manual & Semi-Automated Reporting
        - Config-Driven, customized Workflows & Data Conversion APIs

  - role: Lead Developer, Product Owner
    time: 2008 - 2011
    company: Schönhofer Sales and Engineering (SSE), Germany
    details: |
      In 2007, Schönhofer looked for a complete relaunch of their own geospatial mapping solution.
      They envisioned a fast 3D [Virtual Globe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_globe) application
      that could handle **millions of dynamic map objects, moving & updating in realtime**. 
      At the time, **none of the existing solutions could meet these requirements** (e.g. [Google Earth](https://www.google.com/earth/)).
      
      Hired directly from the Computer Graphics Department, University of Bonn, i was happily accepting
      the great opportunity to help envisioning & creating the complete greenfield relaunch 
      as well as integrating it into Schönhofer's [TARAN Product Suite](https://www.schoenhofer.de/produkte/taran-suite/).
